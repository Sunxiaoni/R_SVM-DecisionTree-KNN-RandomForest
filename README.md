# R_Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-

The dataset of iris is a typical dataset for machine learning algorithm practice. 

Here, I have implemented SVM, decision tree, k-nearest neighbours, random forest to compare the accuract rate among different models.

SVM model provides better performance comparing with others.

Secondly, compute theRMSE, root meansquare error to compare the result of SVM and linear regression algorithm.
